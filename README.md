# COVID-19 Data Exploration: SQL and Tableau

![COVID-19](https://yourimageurl.com)

Welcome to the **COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL and Tableau** project repository. This project is dedicated to delving into the depths of COVID-19 data through the combined power of SQL querying and Tableau visualization. By harnessing the capabilities of these tools, we aim to gain meaningful insights into the pandemic's impact and trends.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find resources and files related to our data exploration endeavor. I have taken COVID-19 data and applied rigorous SQL analysis to unearth valuable information. The culmination of our efforts can be witnessed through the dynamic visualizations created using Tableau.

## Data Source

Our exploration is built on a comprehensive dataset containing COVID-19 statistics, encompassing cases, recoveries, deaths, and more. The data was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and is available in [CovidDeaths](CovidDeaths.xlsx) and [CovidVaccinations](CovidVaccinations.xlsx)

## SQL Analysis

I've conducted intricate SQL queries on the dataset to extract valuable insights. The SQL scripts used for analysis are available in the [SQL](SQL) directory. Feel free to peruse and adapt these queries for your own projects.

## Tableau Visualizations

To visually present the findings, I've employed Tableau to create interactive and insightful dashboards. These visualizations can be explored in the [Tableau](Tableau) directory. Dive into the data by interacting with the different elements and gain a deeper understanding of the pandemic's patterns.

## How to Use

1. Explore the SQL scripts in the [SQL](SQL) directory to see the data analysis methods.
2. Visit the [Tableau](Tableau) directory to view the interactive visualizations.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! If you have ideas for improving the analysis, enhancing visualizations, or any other enhancements, feel free to submit pull requests. 

Thank you for joining me on this data exploration journey. Let's uncover the insights hidden within the COVID-19 data together! üìäüåçü¶†
